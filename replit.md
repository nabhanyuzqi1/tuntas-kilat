# Tuntas Kilat - Service-on-Demand Platform

## Overview

Tuntas Kilat is a comprehensive service-on-demand platform that provides car wash, motorcycle wash, and lawn mowing services through a WhatsApp-based booking system. The application features a modern React frontend with Express.js backend, utilizing Drizzle ORM for database management and PostgreSQL for data storage.

## System Architecture

The application follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between frontend, backend, and shared components:

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript, using Vite as the build tool
- **Backend**: Express.js server with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: Replit's OpenID Connect authentication system
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components with Radix UI primitives and Tailwind CSS

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite with custom configuration for development and production
- **UI Components**: Shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom design tokens and dark mode support
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state management
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for live updates

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured for Neon serverless)
- **Authentication**: Passport.js with OpenID Connect strategy for Replit auth
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL store
- **WebSocket**: Real-time communication for order tracking
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with proper error handling

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive PostgreSQL schema managed by Drizzle ORM:

- **Users**: Customer and worker profiles with role-based access
- **Services**: Available services (car wash, motorcycle wash, lawn mowing)
- **Orders**: Booking system with status tracking
- **Workers**: Service provider management
- **Addresses**: Customer location management
- **Conversations**: Chat/messaging system

- **Sessions**: Authentication session storage

## Data Flow

1. **Authentication Flow**: Users authenticate through Replit's OAuth system
2. **Service Discovery**: Users browse available services with real-time pricing
3. **Booking Process**: Multi-step booking form with address validation
4. **Order Management**: Real-time order tracking with WebSocket updates
5. **Worker Assignment**: Automatic or manual worker assignment based on availability
6. **Status Updates**: Live tracking through various order states (pending → confirmed → assigned → in progress → completed)
