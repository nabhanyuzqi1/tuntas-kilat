# Firebase App Hosting Deployment Fix

## Problem Analysis

The application works perfectly in development mode but fails with 503/500 errors when deployed to Firebase App Hosting at `https://tuntas-kilat-app--tuntas-kilat.asia-east1.hosted.app`.

### Root Causes Identified:

1. **Server Binding Issue**: Server needs to bind to `0.0.0.0:8080` for Firebase App Hosting container compatibility
2. **Health Check Missing**: Firebase App Hosting requires health check endpoints for container monitoring
3. **Build Process**: ESBuild compilation might have module import issues in production
4. **Environment Variables**: Missing or incorrect environment variable configuration

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Server Configuration Fix
- ✅ Added health check endpoint at `/health`
- ✅ Added root API endpoint at `/` for connectivity verification
- ✅ Server binds to `0.0.0.0` with proper PORT environment variable handling

### 2. AppHosting.yaml Configuration
- ✅ Fixed duplicate environment variable declarations
- ✅ Proper PORT=8080 configuration for Firebase App Hosting
- ✅ NODE_ENV=production for production mode
- ✅ All required Firebase environment variables configured

### 3. Production Build Process
- ✅ Vite build for frontend assets
- ✅ ESBuild compilation for backend server
- ✅ Proper module format (ESM) with external packages

## Testing Commands

### Local Development Test:
```bash
# Test current development server
curl http://localhost:5000/api/services
```

### Production Build Test:
```bash
# Build application
npm run build

# Test production server
NODE_ENV=production PORT=8080 node dist/index.js

# Test health endpoint (in another terminal)
curl http://localhost:8080/health
curl http://localhost:8080/api/services
```

### Deployment Validation:
```bash
# Run deployment test script
chmod +x scripts/deploy-app-hosting.sh
./scripts/deploy-app-hosting.sh
```

## Expected Results After Fix

When deployed to Firebase App Hosting, the following endpoints should work:

1. **Health Check**: `GET /health` → `{ "status": "healthy", "timestamp": "...", "service": "tuntas-kilat-api" }`
2. **Root API**: `GET /` → `{ "message": "Tuntas Kilat API Server", "version": "1.0.0", "status": "running" }`
3. **Services API**: `GET /api/services` → Array of services data
4. **Authentication**: `POST /api/auth/whatsapp/send-otp` → OTP functionality

## Firebase App Hosting Requirements Met

- ✅ Container binds to port 8080
- ✅ Server responds to health checks
- ✅ Proper environment variable handling
- ✅ ESM module format compatibility
- ✅ Express.js server with proper error handling
- ✅ Static file serving for frontend assets

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. Ensure all environment variables are configured in Firebase Console
2. Deploy using Firebase CLI: `firebase deploy --only hosting`
3. Monitor container logs for any runtime issues
4. Test all API endpoints after deployment

## Monitoring and Debugging

If deployment still fails:

1. Check Firebase App Hosting logs in Firebase Console
2. Verify environment variables are properly set
3. Test local production build first
4. Ensure all dependencies are properly installed during build process
