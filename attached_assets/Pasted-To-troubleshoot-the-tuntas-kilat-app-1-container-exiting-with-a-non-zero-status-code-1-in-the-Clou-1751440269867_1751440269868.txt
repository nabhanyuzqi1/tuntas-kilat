To troubleshoot the tuntas-kilat-app-1 container exiting with a non-zero status code (1) in the Cloud Run revision tuntas-kilat-app-build-2025-07-02-002 , you should investigate the following:

Module Not Found Error : The logs indicate an ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND error for the package 'vite' imported from /workspace/dist/index.js . This suggests that the vite package is missing or not correctly bundled in your container image.
Action : Verify that vite is listed as a dependency in your package.json and that it is properly installed during your build process. Ensure that the dist/index.js file correctly references vite and that vite is available in the final image.
Container Startup Probe Failure : The revision status, obtained by running gcloud run revisions describe tuntas-kilat-app-build-2025-07-02-002 --region asia-east1 , shows that the container failed to start and listen on port 8080 within the allocated timeout. The startup probe is configured with a timeout of 240 seconds and a failure threshold of 1.
Action : Confirm that your application inside the container is indeed listening on port 8080. If your application takes longer to start, consider increasing the timeoutSeconds for the startup probe in your Cloud Run service configuration.
Container Exiting with Status 1 : The log entry "Container called exit(1)" confirms that the application process within the container terminated abnormally. This is often a direct result of the module not found error or other unhandled exceptions during startup.
Action : Review your application's startup script and main entry point ( dist/index.js ) for any potential issues that could cause it to exit prematurely.
